# Ludo Game


Command line application to play Ludo with a small graphical interface.

## Scope

This was one of my first java codes, developed as a final project for the Introduction to Programming course.

Comments and function names are in Portuguese.
It's just a small project that might inspire new programmers to start their study on Java.
